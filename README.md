[zsh]: http://www.zsh.org/

This package provides syntax highlighing for the shell zsh.  It enables
highlighing of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an
interactive terminal.  This helps in reviewing commands before running
them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

Some examples:

FAQ
---

### Why must `zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` be sourced at the end of the `.zshrc` file?

`zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` wraps ZLE widgets.  It must be sourced after all
custom widgets have been created (i.e., after all `zle -N` calls and after
running `compinit`).  Widgets created later will work, but will not update the
syntax highlighting.

### Does syntax highlighting work during incremental history search?

Highlighting the command line during an incremental history search, which is
bound by default to <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> in zsh's emacs keymap, requires zsh 5.3.2
or newer.

See [issue #288][i288] and [issue #415][i415] for details.

How to tweak
------------

Syntax highlighting is done by pluggable highlighter scripts.  See the
[documentation on highlighters](docs/highlighters.md) for details and
configuration settings.
