- Aliases that cannot be defined normally nor invoked normally (highlighted as an error).

- Work around upstream bug that triggered when the command word was a relative
  path, that when interpreted relative to a $PATH directory denoted a command;
  the effect of that upstream bug was that the relative path was cached as
  a "valid external command name".
  (#354, #355, 51614ca2c994, fdaeec45146b, 7d38d07255e4;
  upstream fix slated to be released in 5.3 (workers/39104))

  variable, which is in the highlighters' namespace.
  (3e59ab41b6b8, 80148f6c8402, f91a7b885e7d)

- Rename highlighter entry points.  The old names remain supported for
  backwards compatibility.
  (a3d5dfcbdae9, c793e0dceab1)

  (0a9b347483ae)
